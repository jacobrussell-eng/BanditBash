      "question": "Doing the right thing. It depends on the situation. Killing a wild, violent wolf is partially justifiable. You dash over and grab the large mallet, swing and smash along the side of his jaw. Now he's really mad. You batter his head in a bit more then he swings his sword, and it gets lodged in the head of the mallet. You pull it away, then push it back to him and hit him in the stomach and his sword drives right through it's neck. His face freezes and he very slowly collapses backwards. You felt like a hero. After that situation you become a hero in the streets, for all of those whose situation is wrongly justified or wasn't treated to by the royal guards. You're pretty much a powerless superman.",

      "question": "You whistle and try to lead him into a pen. He just stares at you and says 'Uhh... What are you doing?' You explain that you're ending his villainous reign and he replies saying that he's actually just trying to put the owner out of business as he's a scummy trader and always puts people in bad situations. Realising how dumb you seem now, you join his side and slaughter the rest of the chickens and go back to the Wolf's hangout. There is an entire pack of Wolf Barabarians investigating and shutting down criminals. You are so happy. You've dicovered freaking Wolf Detectives. How awesome is that. Anyways you then become a lead investigator and solve cases.",

From afar you shoot multiple arrows and hit in the: Knee, Shoulder and other eye. Howling in pain, the wolf collapses to the floor. A passerby shouts to you 'Nice Shot pal!'

He also mentions that they're looking for new members. You sign on and learn sniping tricks and all about angles and tilting of the bow. Finally, before heading into a huge battle, you are gifted with a golden and jewelled bow. After the successful war, you are now part of the group. You are an Archer and Marksman.",

    "question": "You enter the competition with your Griffin, Tyrell, and go through rounds of fighters and beasts and successfully win all of the rounds with a breeze. But now it's the final round. The most important part. Malik Roughclaw. The Big Deal. He enters the arena from the shadows with his Frost Lynx. 'LET THE BATTLE, COMMENCE!' Tyrell dahes into the sky, trying to flank but is instantly frozen but the Frost Lynx and falls out of the air. Meanwhile, you are charging towards Malik and waving your Gold Battle Axe around, but to no Avail. Malik is craftily dodging and ducking past all swings and countering them. You get the idea to trick him, fake swing and get rough. You go fists swinging, smashing Malik hard. He has no clue what to do. The Lynx tries to get involved but you grab and use it as a weapon against Malik. He calls apon a Beam of Light, a last resort. The energy crashes down from the skies, wrecking the Terrain. But Malik doesn't know that you have prepared for this, You are Ready. You get yourself in a position and take the hit. It's unbelieveable. Absorbing so much energy would kill a regular person. You are not regular. You blast all of it back at Malik. You practically obliverate him. On his last breath he says the words. 'You, with no doubt, are the Champion. A better Champion than I was. Well Fought...'",
